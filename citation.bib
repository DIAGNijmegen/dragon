	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence can mitigate the global shortage of medical diagnostic personnel but requires large-scale annotated datasets to train clinical algorithms. Natural Language Processing ({NLP}), including Large Language Models ({LLMs}), shows great potential for annotating clinical data to facilitate algorithm development but remains underexplored due to a lack of public benchmarks. This study introduces the {DRAGON} challenge, a benchmark for clinical {NLP} with 28 tasks and 28,824 annotated medical reports from five Dutch care centers. It facilitates automated, large-scale, cost-effective data annotation. Foundational {LLMs} were pretrained using four million clinical reports from a sixth Dutch care center. Evaluations showed the superiority of domain-specific pretraining ({DRAGON} 2025 test score of 0.770) and mixed-domain pretraining (0.756), compared to general-domain pretraining (0.734, p {\textless} 0.005). While strong performance was achieved on 18/28 tasks, performance was subpar on 10/28 tasks, uncovering where innovations are needed. Benchmark, code, and foundational {LLMs} are publicly available.},
